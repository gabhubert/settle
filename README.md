# Settle

An experimental project aiming at making distributed currency issuance and
exchange easy and accessible.

The guiding principles are the following:
- **No central currency**: getting rid of central currencies (such as Bitcoin)
  frees the system from the need of a shared blockchain, enabling entirely free
  transactions, just like email--and in particular micropayments.
- **Easy asset issuance and trust**: issuing an asset or currency and
  expressing trust in other users issued assets is made as easy as conceivable,
  enabling liquidity between these issued assets; such as:
  - enabling you to buy coffee from your local store with IOUs you issued to
    your friends and families.
  - using assets earned in CounterStrike to pay for your Lyft ride.
  - refunding as a merchant with assets that are guaranteed to be redeemed on
    your platform but still usable by your users to pay for other products.
- **Open network**: anyone can join or use the network. Private networks can be
  run independently. The public network of mints would transparently survive
  our own mint going offline.
