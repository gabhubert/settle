*Decentralized trust graph for value exchange on the Internet*

While cryptocurrencies are maintained by distributed ledgers with no central
authority, their trust model and graph is still fully centralized: everyone has
to trust the currency.

Settle's goal is to explore a new trust primitive on the Internet, and doing
so, construct a decentralized trust graph that can be leveraged to achieve
fluid and free exchange of value between humans and machines.
