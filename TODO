# mint

 [ ] replace 1000*1000 by protocol constant
 [ ] attempt to use Amount everywhere?
 [ ] transaction protocol
 [ ] propagation protocol for both operations and offers (need to learn more)
 [ ] pass DSN for DB, support Postgres
 [x] make user optional for propagated transactions (or other objects)
 [x] move status values to protocol
 [x] move Execute to ctx
 [x] remove nil from creation operation, prevent issuer from owning balance
 [x] rename Normalized something Address to Owner
 [x] split controller into endpoint.CreateXXX object with Execute and Validate
 [x] move mint host to context

  # test

    [x] make the DB a context value that can be created independently for tests
    [x] find a way to set the MintHost after start or set the mux after creating the httptest.Server
    [x] support in memory db

# site

  [ ] have the get started guide on github, to generate stars?

# notes

  # offers and operations

  - the canonical mint has the truth so no need for a 2 step commit or blocking
    on other mints, just rely on best effort propagation (hence protocol
    necessarily different from transactions)
  - mints are eventually consistent on operations and offers
  - propagation happens asynchronously and can be (is?) triggered by clients

  # transactions

  - the chain of calls include
    - operation
    - crossing
    - operation
    - crossing
    - operation

  - each element of the chain commit to performing the operation/crossing if
    provided with the lock. The operation/offer updates are propagated
    (best-effort) only once they are committed
