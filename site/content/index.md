# Settle

*Decentralized trust graph for value exchange without a blockchain.*

While cryptocurrencies are maintained by distributed ledgers with no central
authority, their trust model and graph is still fully centralized: everyone has
to trust the currency.

Settle's goal is to explore a new financial trust primitive on the Internet,
and doing so, construct a decentralized trust graph enabling (totally) free
exchange of value without relying on a blockchain.

## Getting started

Install `settle` locally (under `~/.settle`):
```
curl -L https://settle.network/install | sh && export PATH=$PATH:~/.settle
```

Register on a mint:
```
settle register
```
